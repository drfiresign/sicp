# Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programs Exercises

## Introduction

and the time will vanish from my life, leaving an empty and incomplete attempt
at completing the wizard book.

But maybe, _juuuuust maybe_, I'll actually complete this project. And then maybe
I'll have learned something.
